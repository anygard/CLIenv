CLIenv
======
This is the setup of my personal workspace. A collection of CLI settings and
configurations designed to make life easier.

This used to include my Vim configuration but that has been refactored into its own repository, found [here](https://github.com/anygard/.vim).

Dynamic vs Static
-----------------
In this context dynamic refers to things that need to be set at each session
start, Aliases, Environment variables or comand line completions. Conversly
static refers to regular config files that only need to be installed in the
right place to be /active/.

Debugging
---------
set $CLIENV_DEBUG=Y for debugging install.sh
